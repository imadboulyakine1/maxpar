This program is used to check the maximum number of parameters a C++ program can handle.

**Solution:**

I believe there is no strict limit imposed by the C++ compiler itself. The practical limit is determined by the amount of RAM available on the system. Here's a breakdown:

* Each parameter, when declared and assigned, typically occupies 8 bytes of memory.
* The maximum number of parameters you can use depends on the available RAM in your device. 

Unfortunately, I was unable to determine the exact maximum parameter limit on my device as the program crashed before reaching it. I have included some screenshots showing the RAM usage and how it changes during the test.

As you can see, the program did not exhaust all available RAM before crashing. This suggests that the crash might be caused by the kernel or Visual Studio Code itself, rather than a hard limit imposed by the compiler.
